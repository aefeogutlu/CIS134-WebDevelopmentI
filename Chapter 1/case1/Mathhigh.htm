		<h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1> <!-- Step 11 -->


		<p> <!-- Step 12 -->
		The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> <!-- Step 13 -->was 
		born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of 
		mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong><!-- Step 13 -->. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
		and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
		prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and 
		papers</em> <!-- Step 13 -->. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.
		</p>

		<p> <!-- Step 12 -->
		He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's 
		work, <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite><!-- Step 14 -->, remained a standard textbook in the field for 
		well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote 
		<cite>Lettres &#224; <!-- Step 15 --> une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, giving a clear 
		non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the 
		time.
		</p>
		
		<p> <!-- Step 12 -->
		One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. 
		Notations still in use today, such as <var>e</var> <!-- Step 16 --> and &#960;,<!-- Step 16 --> were introduced 
		in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind 
		a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals 
		of mathematics.

		Euler's Equation
		</p>

		<p> <!-- Step 19 -->
		cos(<var>x</var>)  + <var>i</var>sin(<var>x</var>) = <var>e</var><sup>(ix)</sup><!-- Step 20 added the var elements and created the superscript -->
		</p>
		
		<p> <!-- Step 19 -->
		demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, 
		and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
		the identity
		</p>
		
		<p> <!-- Step 19 -->
		<var>e</var><sup>(&#960<var>i</var>)</sup> + 1 = 0 <!-- Step 21 replaced pi e and i and created superscript -->
		</p>
		
		<p> <!-- Step 19 -->
		which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &#960, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> <!-- Step 22 replaced e i and pi -->in
		a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers 
		conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> <!-- Step 23 --> magazine named 
		Euler's Identity as the 
		most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.
